# DeepIRES
DeepIRES: a hybird deep learning model for indentifying internal ribosome entry site in mRNA
## EXPLANATION
This repository contains four folders: model, dataset, weights, data, and result.
### Model
This folder contains python code files for constructing model.
### Dataset
This folder contains orginal data, traing dataet and testing dataset we constructed.
### Weights
This folder saves the model weights we trained.
### Data
You can put your input data in .fa format  in this folder to run prediction program. It already contains our testing sets
### Result
This folder is used to save prediction output file
## Installation of DeepIRES and environment
Download the repository and create corresponding environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/SongLab-at-NUAA/DeepIRES.git
cd ./DeepIRES
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Then activate virtual enviroment

```
conda activate DeepIRES
```
## USAGE
Run DeepIRES.py file to predict IRES
```
python DeepIRES.py -i input_file -o output_name 
```
```
-i input file : the input file in .fa or .fasta format.This file should be located in **data** folder containing the sequneces you want to predict.
-o output name : the output name you want to use.The result is saved in .csv format in **result** folder.
```
### For example
```
python DeepIRES.py -i main_independent.fa -o main
python DeepIRES.py -i core.fa -o core
python DeepIRES.py -i 5utr_independent.fa -o 5utr
```
There are four columns in the prediction results tabularï¼šsequence name, IRES score, the start locations of region may contain IRES, the termination locations of region may contain IRES.
